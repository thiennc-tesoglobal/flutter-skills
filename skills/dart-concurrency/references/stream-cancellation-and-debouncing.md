# Stream Cancellation and Debouncing

Streams model sequences of asynchronous events over time. Failure to cancel subscriptions or handle race conditions between events is a major source of memory leaks and stale UI states.

## Subscription Lifecycle and Cancellation

- **Always Store and Cancel**: Never call `.listen()` without assigning the returned `StreamSubscription` to a variable that is explicitly cancelled in `dispose()`, `close()`, or during component unmount.
- **Cancel on Re-trigger**: When starting a new asynchronous operation from user input (e.g., search queries), cancel the previous subscription before listening to the new stream:
  ```dart
  await _searchSubscription?.cancel();
  _searchSubscription = repository.search(query).listen(...);
  ```
- **StreamController Ownership**: A controller must be closed by the class that instantiates it. Never leave a controller open after its consumers are unmounted. Check `isClosed` before adding events if emissions can race with disposal.

## Debouncing and Throttling

- **Debounce**: Delay event processing until a quiet period has elapsed. Essential for text input and auto-complete to avoid request storms:
  ```dart
  // Using rxdart or a timer-based transformer
  stream.debounceTime(const Duration(milliseconds: 300));
  ```
- **Throttle / Audit**: Emit the first event immediately and ignore subsequent events for a duration. Useful for button debouncing (preventing double taps).

## Ordering and Latest-Wins (SwitchMap Pattern)

- When an asynchronous operation produces an asynchronous result, sequential calls can complete out of order (a slow earlier query finishing after a fast later query).
- Use `switchMap` semantics: map incoming events to a new stream, automatically cancelling the previous inner stream.
- Alternatively, assign an incrementing sequence token to each request and discard responses with a token older than the latest dispatched request.

## Testing Asynchronous Streams

- Use `package:fake_async` to control virtual time deterministically. Avoid `Future.delayed` in unit tests.
- Test edge cases: stream errors, early cancellation before completion, rapid succession of inputs, and unmounting while an asynchronous emission is in flight.
