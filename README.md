Agent Skills for building, reviewing, testing, and shipping Flutter and Dart apps, informed by real-world projects.

Give your coding agent focused guidance that respects your project's architecture and packages, checks API assumptions, and backs completion claims with verification evidence.

## Install

```sh
npx @thiennc/flutter-skills
```

Installs into the current project. Add `--global` to use across projects.

## Use

Start with `flutter-app-workflow` for a feature, or name a specialist for a focused task:

```text
Use $flutter-openapi-client to read this Swagger contract and generate
the Customer APIs using this project's existing networking stack.
```

Skills guide the agent through implementation and verification, with clear reporting of what was tested and what remains unverified.
