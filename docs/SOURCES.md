# Source policy

Flutter and Dart evolve quickly. Technical guidance in this collection should prefer current primary sources and preserve the target project's declared SDK constraints.

Package-specific claims should use the package publisher's documentation and confirm compatibility with the project's SDK constraints. Community articles may provide examples but must not override current primary documentation.

MCP integration must be capability-aware: use the semantic or runtime tools when the current agent exposes them, and preserve a CLI fallback so each skill remains portable. Agent behavior claims should be supported by forward evaluations when practical; deterministic schema checks alone are not behavior evidence.

## Upstream relationship

The official `flutter/agent-plugins` repository is a trusted reference and inspiration for focused workflows such as architecture, responsive layout, routing, HTTP, serialization, localization, and tests. This repository maintains independent wording, broader delivery coordination, package-neutral decision rules, and its own evaluations and quality gates.
